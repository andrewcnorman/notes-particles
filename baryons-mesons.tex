\subsection{Baryons ($\Pquark\Pquark\Pquark$ or $\APquark\APquark\APquark$)}

Baryons have a baryon number $B$ of $+1$, are made of three quarks, and have a lepton number $L$ of $0$.  They may or may not have a strangeness, which depends on whether they contain strange quarks. (Antibaryons contain three antiquarks, and have a baryon number of $-1$.)

Of all the baryons, only the proton is stable (and the standard model suggests its half life may be around $10^{32}$~years, cf. present age of the universe $\sim 10^{10}$~years).  All other baryons are unstable and will eventually decay into protons (e.g.\ free neutrons which are not bound up in nuclear matter\footnote{When bound up in a nucleus, neutron instability via beta decay is balanced against the instability of the nucleus as a whole from the coulomb repulsion of the resulting additional proton, so bound neutrons are not necessarily unstable\ldots} will decay to protons with a half-life of about 10 minutes, 14 seconds).

\caption{There are many more baryons than the combinations of the six quark flavours suggests ($^{6}C_{3}\times 2=40$), as the quarks have energy levels (like electrons).  The $\Delta^{+}$ (delta plus) particle, for example, has the same quark structure as the proton, but is more massive as its quarks have more energy, and spin differently.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mesons ($\Pquark\APquark$)}

Mesons have a baryon number of zero, and a lepton number of zero.  They are made up of a quark and an antiquark.  None of the mesons are stable.

            \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


*Due to their composition, the antiparticles of the pi-plus and the K-plus are not the antipi-plus and K-plus (as might be expected), but are instead the pi-minus and K-minus.

There are many more mesons than those listed!

\section{Quark structure of hadrons}

In the early 1960s, the number of known hadrons was large enough for physicists to start to make patterns and reduce the large numbers to a simpler scheme.  Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig put together the theory that the hadrons were made up of smaller constituents named quarks.\footnote{Experimental evidence for quarks was first provided in 1969 when electrons of de Broglie wavelength \SI{e-16}{m} were fired at protons.  As this is about 10 times smaller than the proton, these electrons can resolve internal structure, finding three particles inside the proton.}

\subsection{Quark combinations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Baryons are composed of three quarks ($\Pquark\Pquark\Pquark$) and antibaryons are composed of three antiquarks ($\APquark\APquark\APquark$).
\item Mesons are composed of a quark and an antiquark ($\Pquark\APquark$).
\end{enumerate}

  \begin{tabular}{lclc}

\end{table}

The \Ppizero is actually a combination of $\Pup\APup+\Pdown\APdown$, but can be regarded as just one of these.  When a meson is made of a quark-antiquark pair in this way (e.g.\ a \Pup and \APup, which appear to be antiparticles) these quarks do not annihilate, as they have another property (colour\footnote{Colour is just a label---not a real colour!---for the charge of the strong interaction.  Unlike electric charge ($+$ or $-$), the strong charge comes in three colours: R, G and B.}) which is different for the two quarks.  This means that the \Pup and \APup in a \Ppizero, having different colours, do not annihilate.
